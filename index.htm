			<p>My name is Malia, and I'm a front end web developer. I enjoy making minimalist and functional websites
			   using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and PHP.

			<p><strong>What is HTML?</strong><br/>
				HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a standard language used to create webpages.
				It was first released in the early 1990s. It was a widely popular, but it had some limitations in its earlier
				versions. However, HTML was widely successful, and many web designers found themselves eager to learn more
				with every new version. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>What is CSS?</strong><br/>
				CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used for formatting documents that are written in markup
				language. CSS can be applied to HTML, XHTML, and any kind of XML. It was initially released in 1996, which means
				that websites prior to that time had to rely solely on HTML for formatting and coding. <br/><br/>
				
				Prior to CSS, web designers tried their best to keep their code organized and efficient. However, that was still
				difficult until the release of CSS. The ability to use style sheets allowed web designers to better organize their code 
				and keep everything clean and efficient.
